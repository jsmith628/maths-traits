//!
//!Traits for sets with a single binary operation and various properties of that operation
//!
//!Currently, the group operation is interpreted as being either the [`Add`] or [`Mul`] operation,
//!and each of the group properties in this module have both an additive and multiplicative variant.
//!
//!As it stands currently, there is no real difference between the two, so it is ultimately up
//!to the implementor's preference which one (or both) to use. Obviously though, addition and multiplication
//!carry difference connotations in different contexts, so for clarity and consistency it is
//!suggested to try to follow the general mathematical or programming conventions whenever possible.
//!In particular:
//!* Try to use multiplication for structures with a single operation
//!except when convention dictates otherwise (such as the case of string concatenation).
//!* While the option does exist, avoid implementing a non-commutative or especially a non-associative
//!addition operation unless convention dictates otherwise.
//!* Avoid implementing both an addition and multiplication where the multiplication *doesn't* distrubute
//!or where the addition distributes instead.
//!
//!# Implementation
//!
//!To implement a struct as a group-like structure, the various group-like trait aliases will be usable
//!according to which and how the following properties are implemented:
//!* An additive or multiplicative binary operation:
//!    * Has some function taking any pair of elements from `Self` and outputing any other member of `Self`
//!    * Represented with either [`Add`] and [`AddAssign`] or [`Mul`] and [`MulAssign`] from [`core::ops`]
//!    * (Note that for the auto-implementing categorization traits to work, the corresponding
//!      "Assign" traits must be implemented.)
//!* An identity element:
//!    * Contains a unique element `0` or `1` such that `0+x=x` and `x+0=x` or
//!     `1*x=x`,`x*1=x` for all `x`
//!    * Represented with either [`Zero`] or [`One`] from [`num_traits`]
//!* Invertibility:
//!    * For every `x` in the set, there exists some other `y` in the struct such that
//!     `x*y=1` and `y*x=1` (or `x+y=0` and `y+x=0` if additive), and there exists
//!     a corresponding inverse operation.
//!    * Represented with either [`Neg`], [`Sub`], and [`SubAssign`] or [`Inv`], [`Div`], and [`DivAssign`]
//!      from [`core::ops`] and [`num_traits`]
//!    * Note, again, that the "Assign" variants are required
//!* Commutative:
//!    * If the operation is order invariant, ie `x+y=y+x` or `x*y=y*x` for all `x` and `y`.
//!    * Represented with [`AddCommutative`] or [`MulCommutative`]
//!* Associative:
//!    * If operation sequences are _evaluation_ order invariant, ie `x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z` or `x*(y*z)=(x*y)*z`
//!     for all `x`, `y`, and `z`.
//!    * Represented with [`AddAssociative`] or [`MulAssociative`]
//!
//!# Exponentiation
//!
//!In addition to these traits, it may be desirable to implement a [multiplication](Mul) or
//![exponentiation](num_traits::Pow) operation with particular [integer](crate::algebra::Integer)
//!or [natural](crate::algebra::Natural) type. See [`MulN`], [`MulZ`], [`PowN`], and [`PowZ`] for more details.
//!
//!# Usage
//!
//!Structs with the above properties implemented will be automatically usable under a number of trait
//!aliases for particular group-like structures. These structures follow standard mathematical
//!convention and roughly correspond to a heirarchy varying levels of "niceness" of each
//!binary operation.
//!
//!These structures can be diagrammed as follows:
//!```text
//!    ---Magma---
//!    |         |
//!    |     Semigroup
//!   Loop       |
//!    |      Monoid
//!    |         |
//!    ---Group---
//!         |
//!   Abelian Group
//!```
//!where:
//!* A [Magma](MulMagma) is a set with any binary operation
//!* A [Semigroup](MulSemigroup) is an [associative](MulAssociative) Magma
//!* A [Monoid](MulMonoid) is a Semigroup with an [identity](One) element
//!* A [Loop](MulLoop) is a Magma with an [identity](One) element and [inverses](Invertable)
//!* A [Group](MulGroup) is a Monoid with [inverses](Invertable), or alternatively, an [associative](MulAssociative) Loop
//!* An [Abelian Group](MulAbelianGroup) is a [commutative](MulCommutative) Group
//!
//!For more information, see Wikipedia's article on
//![algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_algebraic_structures)
//!
//!# Additional Notes
//!
//!It is worth noting that this particular system is certainly non-exhaustive and is missing a number
//!of group-like structures. In particular, it is missing the Category-like structures and Quasigroups
//!
//!In the case of categories, this is because as it stands currently, there are few uses for partial
//!operations while including them would add noticeable complexity.
//!
//!In the case of quasigroups however, the reason is because with the way the primitive types are
//!designed, the only way to determine if an addition or subtraction operation is *truely* invertible
//!is to check against the [Neg] or [Inv] traits, as the unsigned integers implement **both** division
//!and subtraction even though technically those operations are not valid on all natural numbers.
//!So seeing as quasigroups aren't particularly useful anyway, the decision was made to omit them.
//!
