//!# Maths Traits
//!
//!A simple to use yet abstract system of mathematical traits for the Rust language
//!
//!# Design
//!
//!The purpose of this crate is to provide a system for working with mathematical objects
//!that is both maximally abstract *and* that is easy to use such that working with mathematical
//!generics and high abstraction is nearly as simple as designing around a specific type.
//!
//!This system can be used in cases ranging broadly from something as simple as making [reals](analysis::Real) number
//!algorithms apply seamlessly to different precisions to simplifying [vector](algebra::VectorSpace)
//!systems such that using polynomials as coordinates is as easy as switching to a [ring module](algebra::RingModule),
//!or even something like separating the different poperties of [rings](algebra::ring_like)
//!from the [Integers](algebra::Integer) so that objects like polynomials can fit into algorithms
//!generally designed for the latter.
//!
//!To accomplish this goal, the provided framework provided is built with a number of design considerations:
//!* For ease of use and implementation, the included systems utilize [standard Rust][std] or well established
//!  libraries, like [`num_traits`], whenever possible instead of creating new systems.
//!* Implementors should only have to consider individual properties of structures while users
//!  should only need to use the single trait for whichever mathematical object has the desired features
//!* The systems have been named and organized to fit mathematical convention as much as possible in
//!  order to add clarity of use while also increasing generality and flexibility
//!
//!# Usage
//!
//!The traits in this framework are split into two collections, a set of traits for individual properties
//!and operations and a set of trait aliases for mathematical structures that have those properties.
//!This way, to support the system, structs need only implement each relevant property, and to use the system,
//!one can simply bound generics by the single alias of whatever mathematical structure fits their needs.
//!
//!For example, to create a generalized `Rational` type,
//!you would implement the standard [`Clone`](Clone), [`Add`](core::ops::Add), [`Sub`](core::ops::Sub),
//![`Mul`](core::ops::Mul),
//![`Div`](core::ops::Div), [`Neg`](core::ops::Neg), [`Inv`](num_traits::Inv), [`Zero`](num_traits::Zero),
//![`One`](num_traits::One) traits, and their assign variants as normal. Then, by implementing the new traits
//![`AddCommutative`](algebra::AddCommutative), [`AddAssociative`](algebra::AddAssociative),
//![`MulCommutative`](algebra::MulCommutative), [`MulCommutative`](algebra::MulAssociative), and
//![`Distributive`](algebra::Distributive), all of the aliases using those operations (such as [`Ring`](algebra::Ring)
//!and [`MulMonoid`](algebra::MulMonoid)) will automatically be implemented and usable for the type.

//!# Currently Supported Constructs
//!
//!Currently, `maths_traits` supports traits for the following systems of mathematical structures:
//! * [Group-Like](algebra::group_like) algebraic structures: monoids, groups, abelian groups, etc
//! * [Ring-Like](algebra::ring_like) algebraic structures: rings, fields, GCD domains, Euclidean domains, etc
//! * [Module-Like](algebra::module_like) structures: vector spaces, algebras, bilinear-forms, etc
//! * [Integer](algebra::integer::Integer) and [Natural](algebra::integer::Natural) numbers
//! * [Ordered](analysis::ordered) algebraic structures: ordered/archimedian rings, fields, etc
//! * [Real](analysis::real::Real) and [Complex](analysis::real::Complex) numbers
//! * [Metric](analysis::metric) properties of sets: metric spaces, inner-product, norm, etc
//!
//!# `no_std`
//!
//!It is possible to use `maths-traits` without the standard library. To do so, simply compile your project
//!without the `std` feature by disabling default features in your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//!```TOML
//![dependencies]
//!maths-traits = {version = "0.2", default-features = false}
//!```
//!
//!However, do note that the implementations of all traits related to [`Real`](analysis::Real) on
//!primitive types will only be available when using `std`, as the floating-point trigonometric
//!and exponential functions are only available when linking to the standard library.
//!
//!# Possible Future Features
//!
//!As `maths_traits` is still in developement, there are a number of features that may be included
//!at a later date:
//! * Traits for vector spaces of finite or countable dimension that have discrete elements. This
//!   will *almost certainly* be added eventually, but hasn't yet due to a number of design
//!   constraints.
//! * Optional default implementations for the other mathematical strutures in the `num` crate.
//! * A system for category-like structures, ie, sets with an operation that is partial over its elements.
//!   This would relatively simple to add, but *so far*, there do not seem to be enough use cases for such a
//!   system in order to offset the added code complexity.
//! * Systems for sets, geometric shapes, and set measure. The might be included in the future, but
//!   so far, they do not seem to fit within the scope of this project.
//!
//!Of course, if anyone feels that any specific feature be added, feel free to file an issue or
//!contribute at the [github](https://github.com/anvil777/maths-traits) repository. Since most
//!of the non-implemeted features are non-implemented due to usefulness concerns, if a feature is
//!requested (and is reasonable), it will probably be added at some point afterward
//!(though this is not a guarantee).
//!
//!# Release Stability
//!
//!At the moment, this project is still in developement, so do note that it is entirely possible
//!for the API to change in the future. I simply do not feel that the crate has had enough use to
//!warrent a feature freeze of any kind, so I would like to leave that within the realm of possibility.
//!
//!_However_, as it stands currently, a fair portion of subsystems have more-or-less been stable in my own
//!personal use for some time, and I would specifically expect most changes to
//!occur in the module-like, metric, and integer systems, so there should not be a terribly large
//!number of breaking changes in the future.
//!
//!Of course, if an API-breaking change _is_ introduced at any point it will be reflected in
//!the semantic-versioning.
//!
